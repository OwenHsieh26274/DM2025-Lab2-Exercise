he last major director we have is Christopher Nolan. As you
watch his movies, you think about what it means for there to be
masters of the art: people who seem to know the tools of the art so
well that they are in complete control of what they’re doing, yet
when you see their work, you can hardly tell how they did it. Nolan is
unique in bringing together high critical praise and very large
audiences, and this time he has decided to do so by bringing
attention to <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a subject of great importance</span>—the making of the atomic
bomb.
Oppenheimer is therefore <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a movie strongly in opposition to the
tendency of our decadence, which is to despise human beings</span>. We
have many humanitarian concerns, especially with victims and
discrimination, but these are essentially condescending. All a victim
can hope to be is what we already are. We ourselves are hopeless—
we cannot go beyond applauding. Nolan, however, shows us a movie
about <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a great and terrible achievement</span>, a scientific and political
achievement, and the man who led that effort. He implies there is no
one of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s stature in our times. We are
diminished, and he wants us to restore greater ambitions, higher
horizons, and perhaps <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">be wiser for the fear we have experienced
contemplating the power we unleashed in WWII</span>.
The structure of the film attempts to bring together in our field of
vision, in Nolan’s by now signature parallel editing style, the various
personal and political concerns of scientific and other public figures
from the 1930s to the ’50s. We see Oppenheimer himself (<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cillian
Murphy, in the role of his career</span>) primarily in color, a giant figure in
the IMAX 70mm format, often in close-up. We follow him from his
graduate school days in physics throughout his career, through
Europe, California, and of course Los Alamos.
This is framed by his testimony, also in color, to a commission that
will eventually remove his security clearance, in 1954, marking the
end of his public career. This testimony is twinned by the 1958
secretary of commerce nomination hearings of Admiral Strauss

(<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">played very well by Robert Downey Jr.</span>), whom the movie blames
for the humiliation of removing Oppenheimer’s clearance. This part
is in black and white. In a bit of poetic justice, the movie shows
Strauss losing his nomination vote after he is humiliated by
scientists who feel Oppenheimer was treated with great indignity by
the politicians. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This approaches the preposterous</span>, with a young
Senator John F. Kennedy noted as among those who sank Strauss.
In reality, the admiral was a remarkable and worthy public servant,
but a Republican facing a Democratic Senate.
he framework for Oppenheimer’s biography is supposed to
achieve something more serious than rescuing his reputation
with a bit of poetic justice. It show us the political context of the
decisions made during WWII and at the beginning of the Cold War,
the great dangers the country faced, and the fact that scientists can
be very unwise people, much more so than the ordinary American
who does not presume to impose his will on the basis of impressive
academic or technical knowledge.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">The most shocking aspect of that difference between the politicians
who did represent the American people and the scientists who
wanted to rule the American people is that more of the scientists
were Communists and some were traitors</span> (obviously, some
politicians were also Communist spies and traitors). Unfortunately
Oppenheimer himself was as stupid as any other intellectual of his
era, but more cautious and perhaps a little more serious. His
brother, whom he brought to work at Los Alamos, did join the
Communist Party against Oppenheimer’s advice. His wife had been
a Communist, as had his mistress. The list goes on. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Oppenheimer
does a great job of showing how blind and ridiculous all these very
educated, upper-class people were</span>. Part-time revolutionaries at one
time or another, but also indignant Americans claiming their rights
when their loyalty was questioned.

O
But there are more serious things than even treason that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the movie
brings to our attention in a way no other movie has before</span>. The
making of the atomic bomb was considered a necessity of war. The
fear was that the Nazis would get there first. Science is not by nature
pro-American, indeed, it has no loyalty. Nazis commanded the
allegiance or obedience of scientists perhaps even better than the
Americans’. Yet the American scientists believed that they were
acting for a just cause, that they were patriotic, and therefore must
have believed that knowledge is good, perhaps especially in the form
of modern natural science. Yet that science that can split the atom
and possibly incinerate our world does not include a branch that
examines the motives of men or their politics. There is a remarkable
sacrifice and perhaps a form of piety in the Progressive confidence of
those men.
The radical distinction between technical knowledge and moral
concerns is the core of the story and drives everything—from the
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">often-jarring sound design</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">inspiriting score</span> to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the editing,
which is relentless</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">pushing us not to the inevitable, the history we
know, but to the inner necessities of the modern world</span>, and all the
way to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the cinematography, which insists on privileging the personal
suffering of Oppenheimer</span>. The man who starts with an ambition to
know the newest things man can know, then grows up to take
responsibility for the Manhattan Project, and ends by believing
he was somehow responsible for atomic energy in the postwar world.
This is a sentimental delusion, since neither science nor politics
cares much for Oppenheimer, but in a way it is testimony to what
was noble in his character, acting to limit war reasonably. But when
you see the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">amazing reconstruction of atomic fire</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you can at least
begin to understand how he could become so afraid of The Bomb</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It
is almost an object of awe</span>.
ppenheimer has a large cast of characters, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">played with a
combination of intensity and modesty</span>. Stars like Matt Damon
and Casey Affleck, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett

and Kenneth Branagh know they are there to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">make Oppenheimer
look impressive</span>, even though Cillian Murphy has never starred in a
big movie. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The result is remarkable</span>: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">they bring out the academic and
social milieu in which this all takes place</span>, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we see the upper
classes of the period with a clarity almost no movie can achieve these
days</span>.
Needless to say, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">I heartily recommend Oppenheimer</span>. I think <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">many
people are likely to want to see it more than once</span> because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it is
overwhelming the first time</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The sound is much better than I had
anticipated</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">noises and voices are mixed together very well</span>—much of
the movie is men in rooms talking—but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the editing sweeps you</span> with
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">few lulls to recollect yourself</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It is too impressive to appreciate
properly on a first viewing</span>, partly because <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it also makes every effort
to acquaint audiences with everyone involved, from Einstein to
Truman, to conjure some familiarity</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It gives a view of an America
that was serious, competent, dignified, and full of purpose</span>. Yet we so
lack that now that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">it might take reflection or more viewings to fully
appreciate what you’re seeing</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">I felt grateful for such a vision of
America</span>.
