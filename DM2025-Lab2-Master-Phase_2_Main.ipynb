      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "Think of it like teaching a child. Instead of giving them a rigid set of instructions for every single situation, you show them examples, let them practice, and they gradually learn to recognize patterns, understand concepts, and apply that knowledge to new, unseen situations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Learning from Data:**\n",
       "*   The core of ML is **data**. ML algorithms are fed large amounts of data, which can be in various forms: numbers, text, images, audio, etc.\n",
       "*   This data acts as the \"experience\" for the machine. The algorithm analyzes this data to identify patterns, relationships, and underlying structures.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Algorithms:**\n",
       "*   ML uses various **algorithms**, which are sets of rules or procedures that the computer follows to learn from the data.\n",

       "\n",
       "**3. Patterns and Relationships:**\n",
       "*   Through the learning process, ML algorithms discover **patterns and relationships** within the data that might be too complex or subtle for humans to easily identify.\n",
       "*   For example, an ML algorithm might learn that certain combinations of symptoms are highly indicative of a particular disease.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Predictions and Decisions:**\n",
       "*   Once trained on data, the ML model can then be used to make **predictions** about new, unseen data.\n",
       "*   It can also be used to make **decisions** based on those predictions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. No Explicit Programming:**\n",
       "*   This is a crucial distinction. In traditional programming, you write explicit instructions for every possible scenario. In ML, you provide the data and the algorithm, and the algorithm figures out the \"rules\" itself.\n",
       "*   For instance, instead of writing code to identify a cat in an image by defining specific pixel patterns, you show an ML model thousands of images labeled \"cat\" and \"not cat,\" and it learns to recognize cats on its own.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Analogy:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine you want to teach a computer to distinguish between apples and oranges.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Traditional Programming:** You'd write code that checks for specific colors (red/green for apples, orange for oranges), shapes (round for both, but maybe slight variations), and textures. This would be very difficult to make robust and would fail with unusual varieties.\n",
       "*   **Machine Learning:** You'd show the computer thousands of pictures of apples and thousands of pictures of oranges, labeling each one. The ML algorithm would then learn the distinguishing features (color, shape, texture, stem presence, etc.) on its own. Once trained, it could accurately identify new apples and oranges it has never seen before.\n",

       "*   **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs). The goal is to predict an output for new inputs.\n",
       "    *   *Examples:* Image classification (identifying objects in images), spam detection, predicting house prices.\n",
       "*   **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on unlabeled data. The goal is to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",

And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
